This is a workforce app project.
The goal is building an high quality PWA app with basic Javascript and JQuery

It is deployed at edward-pwaProject.surge.sh

To launch locally, launch web Server for chrome and launch the URL the server is using.

At the moment, I am using stock price API for the content.
Implemented functionalities are
- several stock price is received using API
- if network is not connected, cached data is used
- App can be installed as mobile app
